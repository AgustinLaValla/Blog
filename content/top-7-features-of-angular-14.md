# Top 7 Features of Angular 14

Angular 14 was one of the most anticipated updates to the enormously popular platform. It was released in June 2022, and many important and useful features were included. This article explains the top seven features of Angular 14 that every developer should know.

Let’s walk through these features one by one.

## 1. Standalone components, directives, and pipes

n Angular 14, you can create a module-less Angular application using the standalone flag. Right now, this feature is in the developer preview state.

```ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
import { bootstrapApplication } from '@angular/platform-browser';

@Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    standalone: true,
    imports: [
        // import standalone Components, Directives, and Pipes
        CommonModule // and NgModules
    ],
    template: '<h1>Hello World!</h1>',
})
export class SampleComponent {}
// Bootstrap a new Angular application using our `SampleComponent` as a root component.
bootstrapApplication(SampleComponent);

```

## 2. Typed Angular forms

Typed forms ensure that the values inside form controls, groups, and arrays are type-safe across the entire API surface. This enables safer forms, especially for deeply nested complex cases. The schematic ng update provides backward compatibility for your existing forms. Syncfusion’s Angular Forms components are compatible with the typed Angular forms functionality.

```ts

export class SampleComponent {
  var contactForm = new FormGroup({
   name: new FormControl<string>('', { nonNullable: true }),
   email: new FormControl<string>('', { nonNullable: true }),
   contactNumber: new FormControl<number>(0, { nonNullable: false })
  });
}

```

## 3. Streamlined page title accessibility

In Angular 14, we can add the router title without any additional import on the page. Refer to the following code example.

```ts
const routes: Routes = [{
    path: 'home',
    component: HomeComponent
    title: 'Home page'  // <-- Page title
}, {
    path: 'about',
    component: AboutComponent,
    title: 'About page'  // <-- Page title
}];

```

## 4. Extended developer diagnostics

The extendable developer diagnostics feature provides extendable frameworks that help developers better understand the templates and display suggestions for potential enhancements. It helps improve caching before runtime, provide actionable suggestions for a template, and helps diagnose warnings at compile time.

## 5. More built-in improvements

Angular 14 also includes support for the latest TypeScript 4.7 release and now targets ES2020 by default, which allows the CLI to ship smaller code without paring down features.

## 6. Bind to protected component members

Now you can bind protected component members directly from the template.

```ts

@Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    template: '{{ title }}',  // Now compiles!
})
export class SampleComponent {
    protected title: string = 'Angular 14';
}

```

## 7. Optional injectors in embedded Views

Angular 14 supports passing in an optional injector when creating an embedded view through ViewContainerRef.createEmbeddedView and TemplateRef.createEmbeddedView. This injector enables customization of dependency injection behavior within the specific template.

```ts
viewContainer.createEmbeddedView(templateRef, context, {
  injector: injector,
});
```
